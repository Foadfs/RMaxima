This is a toolbox written in Maxima language, dealing with the kinematics and dynamics of rigid multi-bodies, specially for robotic applications. the toolbox includes functions and methods of screw theory.
This toolbox was initiated by Foad Sojoodi Farimani. But the code is inspired by MATLAB code from (http://freesourcecode.net/matlabprojects/61460/screw-theory-toolbox-in-matlab#.Vxlh7JN940o) written by Hanfucius
